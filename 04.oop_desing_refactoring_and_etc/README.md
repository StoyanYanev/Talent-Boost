Design ATM system that required the user to input one of their accounts number
and their pin to access the account. From there they could either deposit,
withdraw, or check their balance.

**Update 1:** Due to resent security issues found the users should be able to
change their PIN without the need to provide account number just their old PIN.
The new PIN should not be the same as the old one

**Update 2:** Our ATM has tremendous success and now there is need to add
additional types of accounts to the system. First is an account that allow
overdrafts to some predefined amount. Second is account that has restriction on
how much can be withdraw in one go.

**Update 3:** There is further need to extend the ATM system to allow join
accounts where 2 customers own it

**Update 4:** Our system is growing and we are in a position to have second, yes
second, ATM! As we want our customers to be able to use both, the ATMs should be
aware of the same set of customers and account.

Design and implement classes, methods and their signitures that will be needed
or the ATM system.
