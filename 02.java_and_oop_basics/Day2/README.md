**Task 1**

Implement an integer stack in Java.

• The stack should have a void push(int) method which inserts an element.

• The stack should have an int peek() method which returns the top element of
it.

• The stack should have an int pop() method which removes the top element and
returns it.

• The stack should have a way of tracking the count of elements in it and also
an int size()

method which returns it.

Hint:

• You can use more than one class for the implementation (in fact its advised to
do so).

• Do you know what a linked list is?

**Task 2**

Implement an integer queue in Java.

• The queue should have a void enqueue(int) method which adds elements.

• The queue should have an int dequeue() method which removes the next element
and returns

it.

• The queue should have an int peek() method which returns the next element.

• The queue should have a way of tracking the count of elements in it and also
an int size()

method which returns it.

**Task 3**

Think of how you can implement the stack and queue from the previous exercises
in a

“more OOP manner”. What could be improved? What could be done in a more OOP way?

Hint:

• What is the purpose of the stack and the queue? Are they similar in any way?
