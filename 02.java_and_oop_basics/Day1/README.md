**Task 1**

Create a HelloWorld.java class which outputs \`Hello World!\` to the console.
Compile this file using the command line and expects the content of the output.
What do you see? Run this file using the command line.

Modify the file to expects a command line argument which is the name of the
user. When you run the program it should print a personalized greeting with the
name of the user.

**Task 2**

Create an empty array with length provided by the user as a command line
argument and use a while loop to populate it with numbers, starting from 0.

Then use a for loop to get all the even numbers in the array and output them to
the user.

If you feel adventurous, intentionally create a loop condition which makes it
infinite. What happens?

**Task 3**

Create a java class called Matrix. This class should print a Matrix to the user,
containing the numbers from 0 to 50. It should make use of a two-dimensional
array, where each element in the matrix should be a separate array.

**Task 4**

Put all of your classes in a directory and use the command line to create a jar
file containing all of the compiled classes that you have written so far.

Then use the command line to expects the contents of the jar youâ€™ve just
created.

Run the jar file using the command line. For the purposes of this exercise,
specify the personalized Hello program as a starting point. ( In a real world
application all of the files should work together as a single application and
the starting point would be the main method.)
